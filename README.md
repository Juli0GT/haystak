# Haysta:K
##Helping developers efficiently find answers to FAQ's & PAQ's

##Description
Streamline your research process by knowing your most useful answer to previously asked questions.

The Haystak extension allows you to mark a search result (and some highlighted text) as the answer to a google search. When  the same search result appears in another duplicate or similar search, Haystak will indicate the marked answer to you so you immediately find your useful answer in the haystack of useful answers. 

Further features:
- You can review all of your previously searched questions and answers on the new tab page.
- You can tag an answer with useful information to allow you to filter by tag (e.g. filter by all Ruby questions)
